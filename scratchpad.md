# Radium Deploy Demo Platform - Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The goal is to transform the existing Radium Chat application into a compelling demonstration platform called "Radium Deploy". This platform will showcase a simulated workflow for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), deploying them as APIs, and monitoring their performance via analytics, **visually replicating key sections of the Fireworks AI dashboard**.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **State Management:** Managing the list of available models (base, simulated fine-tuned, simulated deployed) across different components (sidebar, chat input, deploy page). A simple client-side solution (React Context or Zustand) should suffice. **The store only tracks model names and types for display purposes.**
- **Visual Replication Accuracy:** Faithfully recreating the layout, components, and styling of the Fireworks AI dashboard screenshots using `shadcn/ui` and Tailwind CSS. This includes replicating multi-step forms and static chart representations.
- **Chat Backend Decoupling:** Ensuring the chat UI's model selection dropdown _only_ affects the display and does _not_ change the actual backend API endpoint used (`http://llm-inference.radium.cloud:8001/v1`).
- **Mock Data & Static Content:** Ensuring the static content (text, labels, placeholder values) used in the replicated UIs matches the screenshots where appropriate.

## High-level Task Breakdown

1.  **Setup & Sidebar Navigation:** Create routes, placeholder pages (`/my-models`, `/fine-tuning`, `/deploy`, `/analytics`), and update the sidebar component to add links _above_ the chat history. _(Completed)_
2.  **Model State Management:** Implement client-side state (Zustand) to hold the list of models (base, fine-tuned, deployed). Initialize with base models. _(Completed)_
3.  **Chat Interface Update:** Add a model selection dropdown to the chat input area, populated from the shared state. Ensure chat requests _always_ hit the hardcoded Llama 2 endpoint. _(Completed)_
4.  **My Models Page UI (Dynamic Table):** Build a dynamic table for the `/my-models` page, reading data from `useModelStore`. Display columns like Name, Status, Source, etc.
5.  **Fine-Tuning Page UI (Accordion Replication):** Replicate the visual layout of the 'Getting Started with Fine-Tuning' screenshot on the `/fine-tuning` page using static components. Focus on visual layout.
6.  **Fine-Tuning Simulation (Accordion):** Implement basic state/navigation to visually step between the static screens of the fine-tuning UI within an accordion. On the final step's "Create Job" button click, simulate completion by adding a new "fine-tuned" model entry to the `useModelStore` and potentially showing a success toast/message. No real job creation or processing.
7.  **Implement Interactive Fine-Tuning Simulation (Side Sheet):**
    - **Refactor `handleCreateJob`:** Remove toast notification.
    - **Integrate `Sheet` Component:** Add `shadcn/ui` Sheet component to `/fine-tuning/create` page.
    - **Manage Sheet State:** Add state to control Sheet visibility.
    - **Add Store Action:** Create `updateModelStatus(modelId, newStatus)` action in `useModelStore`.
    - **Implement Simulation Logic:**
        - On button click, add model to store with status 'fine-tuning'.
        - Open the Sheet.
        - Simulate progress (e.g., using `setTimeout`) updating console-like text in the Sheet.
        - When simulation completes, call `updateModelStatus` to change status to 'fine-tuned'.
    - **Display Completion Links:** Show links to `/fine-tuning` and `/chat-playground` in the Sheet upon simulation completion.
    - **Success Criteria:** Clicking 'Create Job' opens a side sheet simulating job progress realistically; model status is updated correctly in the store; completion links are shown.
8.  **Deploy Page UI (Static Replication):** Replicate *all key static UI elements* (header, informational text, layout, placeholders, buttons) using `shadcn/ui` components in a new `/deploy` page route.
    - Include the model selection dropdown populated from `useModelStore`.
    - **Success Criteria:** The `/deploy` page visually resembles the target screenshot, including a populated model dropdown and all static content. _(User verification needed)_
9.  **Deploy Simulation (Visual):** On the "Deploy Model" button click (or similar based on screenshot), simulate completion by updating the selected model's state in `useModelStore` to 'deployed' (if not already) and potentially displaying a static representation of a deployed endpoint/status based on the screenshot. No real deployment.
    - Add state to `DeployPage` if needed (e.g., to show a static 'deployment complete' message).
    - Implement `handleDeployModel` function triggered by the 'Deploy Model' button.
    - Inside `handleDeployModel`:
        - Get the selected model ID from the dropdown.
        - Call `updateModelStatus` from `useModelStore` to mark the model as 'deployed'.
        - Display a success message (`toast`).
        - Update the UI statically to show a fake endpoint/status message based on the screenshot visuals.
        - Include a link button in the static success message (e.g., "Test Deployed Model").
    - **Success Criteria:** Clicking "Deploy Model" marks the selected model as 'deployed' in the store and updates the UI to statically show a success/endpoint state with a link.
10. **API Access Sheet:** Add button to header (e.g., `ChatHeader`).
    - Implement `Sheet` component triggered by the button.
    - Display the hardcoded endpoint `http://llm-inference.radium.cloud:8001/v1` and a sample `curl` command inside the sheet.
    - **Success Criteria:** Clicking header button opens a sheet displaying the correct hardcoded endpoint information.
11. **Analytics Page UI (Static Replication):** Replicate the visual layout of the 'Usage' dashboard screenshot on the `/analytics` page using static elements (divs, text, potentially placeholder images or simplified SVG shapes) to represent charts/selectors. No dynamic data or charting library required.
    - **Success Criteria:** The `/analytics` page visually resembles the target screenshot using static elements.
12. **Testing & Refinement:** Thoroughly test navigation flow, verify model state updates correctly after simulations, check chat functionality remains unaffected, and ensure UI consistency across light/dark themes.
13. **Dynamic Fine-tuning Job List (Placeholder):** Review if `/fine-tuning` landing page should display a dynamic list of fine-tuning jobs from the store (status `fine-tuning` or `fine-tuned`).
    - If needed, implement a table/list component similar to `/my-models` but filtered for fine-tuning jobs.
    - **Success Criteria:** (If implemented) `/fine-tuning` displays an accurate list of fine-tuning jobs.

### Lessons

*   **Error:** TypeScript error `Type "'succeeded'" is not assignable to type 'ModelStatus'.`
*   **Context:** Occurred when adding a simulated fine-tuned model to the Zustand store in `/fine-tuning/create/page.tsx`.
*   **Solution:** Checked the `ModelStatus` type definition in `hooks/use-model-store.ts` and found the correct status for a completed job is `'fine-tuned'`. Updated the code accordingly.

*   **Error:** TypeScript error `Property 'updateModelStatus' is missing in type '{...}' but required in type 'Model'.`
*   **Context:** Occurred after adding `updateModelStatus` action to `hooks/use-model-store.ts`.
*   **Solution:** Store actions (like `updateModelStatus`) should be defined in the store's actions interface (`ModelStoreActions` or directly in `ModelStore`) and not in the interface for the data items (`Model`). Moved the action definition to the correct interface (`ModelStore`) and removed it from `Model`.
