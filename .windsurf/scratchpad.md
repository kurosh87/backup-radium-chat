# Project Scratchpad

## Background

**New Goal:** The user wants to perform a complete migration of the Radium Chat application's authentication system from NextAuth.js (Auth.js) to Clerk.

## Challenges

- **Dependency Management:** Removing all NextAuth.js dependencies and associated code cleanly.
- **Configuration:** Setting up Clerk API keys and environment variables correctly.
- **API Route Replacement:** Replacing the `[...nextauth]` API route logic with Clerk's handlers or UI components.
- **Middleware Update:** Implementing `clerkMiddleware` with appropriate protected/public route logic based on the application's needs.
- **Frontend Integration:** Replacing NextAuth.js hooks (`useSession`, `signIn`, `signOut`) and components with Clerk equivalents (`useUser`, `useAuth`, `<SignInButton>`, `<SignOutButton>`, `<UserProfile>`, etc.).
- **Backend Integration:** Updating server-side logic (API routes, Server Components, Route Handlers) to use Clerk's `auth()` helper instead of `getServerSession`.
- **Testing:** Ensuring all authentication flows (sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, session management, protected routes) work correctly after migration.

## Task Breakdown

**Phase 1: Setup & Middleware**
1.  **Install Clerk:** Add `@clerk/nextjs` package.
2.  **Configure Clerk:** Set up Clerk account, obtain API keys (Publishable Key, Secret Key), and add them to environment variables (`.env.local`).
3.  **Implement Clerk Provider:** Wrap the application layout with `<ClerkProvider>`.
4.  **Update Middleware:** Replace NextAuth.js middleware in `middleware.ts` with `clerkMiddleware`, defining public/protected routes using `createRouteMatcher` (based on the provided Clerk docs and existing app structure).
    *   **Success Criteria:** Unauthenticated users are redirected from protected routes (like the dashboard) to Clerk's sign-in page. *(Refined: Ensure protected routes like the dashboard enforce sign-in).*

**Phase 2: Remove NextAuth.js & Basic UI**
5.  **Remove NextAuth.js Config:** Delete the NextAuth.js API route handler (`/Users/pejman/projects/Radium Chat/app/(auth)/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`) and related configuration files (`/Users/pejman/projects/Radium Chat/app/(auth)/auth.config.ts`).
6.  **Remove NextAuth.js Provider:** Remove the `SessionProvider` wrapping the application.
7.  **Uninstall NextAuth.js:** Remove `next-auth` package.
8.  **Implement Basic Clerk UI:** Add `<SignInButton>`, `<SignOutButton>`, and `<UserButton>` components to the appropriate places in the UI (e.g., header). *(Refined: Implement a dedicated login page and ensure logout redirects to it).*
    *   **Success Criteria:** Users can sign in (via a login page), sign out (redirected to login page), and see their user button using Clerk's basic UI components.

**Phase 3: Code Integration**
9.  **Update Frontend Logic:** Replace `useSession`, `signIn`, `signOut` calls with Clerk's `useUser`, `useAuth`, `openSignIn`, `signOut` etc.
10. **Update Backend Logic:** Replace `getServerSession` calls in Server Components, API routes, and Route Handlers with Clerk's `auth()` helper.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Application logic correctly accesses user authentication state and ID using Clerk helpers both on the client and server.

**Phase 4: Testing & Cleanup**
11. **Thorough Testing:** Test all user flows: sign-up, sign-in (with different providers if configured), sign-out, accessing protected/public pages, API interactions.
12. **Code Cleanup:** Remove any dead code related to NextAuth.js.
13. **Documentation Update:** Update any internal documentation regarding the authentication setup.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Authentication works reliably, and all NextAuth.js remnants are removed.
14. **Fix database schema mismatch for Clerk user IDs:**
    *   **[x] Modify `lib/db/schema.ts` (change `uuid` to `text` for user IDs, remove FKs).**
    *   **[x] Generate Drizzle migration (`pnpm drizzle-kit generate`).**
    *   **Update:** Generated Drizzle migration file `lib/db/migrations/0007_steep_sway.sql`.
    *   **[x] Apply Drizzle migration (`pnpm drizzle-kit push`).**
    *   **[ ] Retest the action causing the DB error.**

## Executor's Feedback

- **Task 5 Complete:** Successfully deleted NextAuth.js API route (`app/(auth)/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`) and config file (`app/(auth)/auth.config.ts`).
- **Task 6 Complete:** Verified that the NextAuth.js `<SessionProvider>` component was not present in the codebase (likely removed previously or never used).
- **Task 7 Complete:** Successfully uninstalled the `next-auth` package using `pnpm remove`.
- **Tasks 9 & 10 Complete:** Successfully refactored `createDocument`, `updateDocument`, and `requestSuggestions` tools and their handlers in `lib/artifacts/server.ts` to use `userId: string` instead of NextAuth `Session`.
- **Task 10 Complete:** Updated `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` to provide `userId` from Clerk's `auth()` result (as `session.userId`) to these tools.
- **Task 10 Complete:** Corrected the import path for Clerk's `auth` helper in the API route.
- **All identified lint errors related to these changes have been addressed.**
- **The primary refactoring for Clerk auth compatibility in the AI tools and chat API route appears complete. Next steps involve building and thoroughly testing the application.**
- **Current Status:** Build successful after fixing Clerk integration issues in multiple files (`route.ts` handlers, page components, layout, fine-tuning page, sign-out form) and a minor JSX lint error.
- **Next Step:** Running `pnpm dev` to start local testing of the authentication flow.
- **Blockers:** None currently. Build is passing.
- **Update:** Staged and committed changes for Clerk build fixes. Waiting for user confirmation to push to GitHub.
- **Update:** Pushed changes to GitHub.
- **Issue:** Encountered DB error `invalid input syntax for type uuid` during local testing.
- **Diagnosis:** Clerk user IDs (`user_...`) are strings, not UUIDs. DB schema needs update.
- **Current Status:** Updated `lib/db/schema.ts` to use `text` for user IDs in `user`, `document`, and `suggestion` tables and removed foreign key constraints.
- **Update:** Generated Drizzle migration file `lib/db/migrations/0007_steep_sway.sql`.
- **Update:** Applied the Drizzle migration to the database.
- **Issue:** Failed to start development server (`pnpm dev`) due to `EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000`.
-*   **Next Step:** User needs to stop the existing process using port 3000. Then, we will restart the dev server and re-test the database fix.
+*   **Update:** User confirmed the conflicting process on port 3000 has been stopped.
+*   **Current Status:** Development server restarted successfully.
+*   **Next Step:** User to re-test the action that previously caused the `invalid input syntax for type uuid` error to confirm the database schema fix.
