# Project Scratchpad

## Background

**New Goal:** The user wants to perform a complete migration of the Radium Chat application's authentication system from NextAuth.js (Auth.js) to Clerk.

## Challenges

- **Dependency Management:** Removing all NextAuth.js dependencies and associated code cleanly.
- **Configuration:** Setting up Clerk API keys and environment variables correctly.
- **API Route Replacement:** Replacing the `[...nextauth]` API route logic with Clerk's handlers or UI components.
- **Middleware Update:** Implementing `clerkMiddleware` with appropriate protected/public route logic based on the application's needs.
- **Frontend Integration:** Replacing NextAuth.js hooks (`useSession`, `signIn`, `signOut`) and components with Clerk equivalents (`useUser`, `useAuth`, `<SignInButton>`, `<SignOutButton>`, `<UserProfile>`, etc.).
- **Backend Integration:** Updating server-side logic (API routes, Server Components, Route Handlers) to use Clerk's `auth()` helper instead of `getServerSession`.
- **Testing:** Ensuring all authentication flows (sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, session management, protected routes) work correctly after migration.

## Task Breakdown

**Phase 1: Setup & Middleware**
1.  **Install Clerk:** Add `@clerk/nextjs` package.
2.  **Configure Clerk:** Set up Clerk account, obtain API keys (Publishable Key, Secret Key), and add them to environment variables (`.env.local`).
3.  **Implement Clerk Provider:** Wrap the application layout with `<ClerkProvider>`.
4.  **Update Middleware:** Replace NextAuth.js middleware in `middleware.ts` with `clerkMiddleware`, defining public/protected routes using `createRouteMatcher` (based on the provided Clerk docs and existing app structure).
    *   **Success Criteria:** Unauthenticated users are redirected from protected routes (like the dashboard) to Clerk's sign-in page. *(Refined: Ensure protected routes like the dashboard enforce sign-in).*

**Phase 2: Remove NextAuth.js & Basic UI**
5.  **Remove NextAuth.js Config:** Delete the NextAuth.js API route handler (`/Users/pejman/projects/Radium Chat/app/(auth)/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`) and related configuration files (`/Users/pejman/projects/Radium Chat/app/(auth)/auth.config.ts`).
6.  **Remove NextAuth.js Provider:** Remove the `SessionProvider` wrapping the application.
7.  **Uninstall NextAuth.js:** Remove `next-auth` package.
8.  **Implement Basic Clerk UI:** Add `<SignInButton>`, `<SignOutButton>`, and `<UserButton>` components to the appropriate places in the UI (e.g., header). *(Refined: Implement a dedicated login page and ensure logout redirects to it).*
    *   **Success Criteria:** Users can sign in (via a login page), sign out (redirected to login page), and see their user button using Clerk's basic UI components.

**Phase 3: Code Integration**
9.  **Update Frontend Logic:** Replace `useSession`, `signIn`, `signOut` calls with Clerk's `useUser`, `useAuth`, `openSignIn`, `signOut` etc.
10. **Update Backend Logic:** Replace `getServerSession` calls in Server Components, API routes, and Route Handlers with Clerk's `auth()` helper.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Application logic correctly accesses user authentication state and ID using Clerk helpers both on the client and server.

**Phase 4: Testing & Cleanup**
11. **Thorough Testing:** Test all user flows: sign-up, sign-in (with different providers if configured), sign-out, accessing protected/public pages, API interactions.
12. **Code Cleanup:** Remove any dead code related to NextAuth.js.
13. **Documentation Update:** Update any internal documentation regarding the authentication setup.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Authentication works reliably, and all NextAuth.js remnants are removed.
14. **Fix database schema mismatch for Clerk user IDs:**
    *   **[x] Modify `lib/db/schema.ts` (change `uuid` to `text` for user IDs, remove FKs).**
    *   **[x] Generate Drizzle migration (`pnpm drizzle-kit generate`).**
    *   **Update:** Generated Drizzle migration file `lib/db/migrations/0007_steep_sway.sql`.
    *   **[x] Apply Drizzle migration (`pnpm drizzle-kit push`).**
    *   **[ ] Retest the action causing the DB error.**

## Executor's Feedback

- **Task 5 Complete:** Successfully deleted NextAuth.js API route (`app/(auth)/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`) and config file (`app/(auth)/auth.config.ts`).
- **Task 6 Complete:** Verified that the NextAuth.js `<SessionProvider>` component was not present in the codebase (likely removed previously or never used).
- **Task 7 Complete:** Successfully uninstalled the `next-auth` package using `pnpm remove`.
- **Tasks 9 & 10 Complete:** Successfully refactored `createDocument`, `updateDocument`, and `requestSuggestions` tools and their handlers in `lib/artifacts/server.ts` to use `userId: string` instead of NextAuth `Session`.
- **Task 10 Complete:** Updated `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` to provide `userId` from Clerk's `auth()` result (as `session.userId`) to these tools.
- **Task 10 Complete:** Corrected the import path for Clerk's `auth` helper in the API route.
- **All identified lint errors related to these changes have been addressed.**
- **The primary refactoring for Clerk auth compatibility in the AI tools and chat API route appears complete. Next steps involve building and thoroughly testing the application.**
- **Current Status:** Build successful after fixing Clerk integration issues in multiple files (`route.ts` handlers, page components, layout, fine-tuning page, sign-out form) and a minor JSX lint error.
- **Next Step:** Running `pnpm dev` to start local testing of the authentication flow.

- **Issue:** Encountered DB error `invalid input syntax for type uuid` during local testing.
- **Diagnosis:** Clerk user IDs (`user_...`) are strings, not UUIDs. DB schema needs update.
- **Current Status:** Updated `lib/db/schema.ts` to use `text` for user IDs in `user`, `document`, and `suggestion` tables and removed foreign key constraints.
- **Update:** Generated Drizzle migration file `lib/db/migrations/0007_steep_sway.sql`.
- **Update:** Applied the Drizzle migration to the database.
- **Issue:** Failed to start development server (`pnpm dev`) due to `EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000`.
-*   **Next Step:** User needs to stop the existing process using port 3000. Then, we will restart the dev server and re-test the database fix.
+*   **Update:** User confirmed the conflicting process on port 3000 has been stopped.
+*   **Current Status:** Development server restarted successfully.
+*   **Next Step:** User to re-test the action that previously caused the `invalid input syntax for type uuid` error to confirm the database schema fix.

## Lessons

*   When using ShadCN UI, if components are missing, use the command `npx shadcn@latest add <component-name> [other-component-names...]` to add them to the project. The older `shadcn-ui` package name is deprecated.
*   Include info useful for debugging in the program output.

# Radium Chat - Deployment API & Backend Scaffolding Plan

## Background (Deployment API)

The user wants to build the backend infrastructure for the "Deployment" section of Radium Chat. This involves:
-   Managing AI models (listing available models, potentially from a database).
-   Handling fine-tuning processes (uploading datasets, creating fine-tuning jobs, tracking status).
-   Managing model deployments (creating new deployments, listing user's deployments, tracking status).
-   Leveraging the existing Neon database with Drizzle ORM.
-   Initially, API routes will be mocked to simulate backend behavior before full implementation.

## Challenges (Deployment API)

-   **Schema Design:** Defining robust and flexible Drizzle schemas for models, fine-tuning jobs (including dataset storage/references), and deployments.
-   **API Design:** Structuring RESTful API routes that are intuitive and cover all necessary CRUD operations for the deployment lifecycle.
-   **Mocking Strategy:** Implementing mock services that realistically simulate asynchronous operations like fine-tuning and deployment provisioning.
-   **File Handling:** Securely handling file uploads for fine-tuning datasets (e.g., JSON files).
-   **State Management:** Tracking the status of long-running processes (fine-tuning, deployment) and reflecting this in the API.
-   **User Association:** Ensuring all deployment-related entities (models, jobs, deployments) are correctly associated with users.

## Task Breakdown (Deployment API)

**Phase 1: New Deployment Form UI (React Components) - Revised to Accordion Layout**
*   **Overall Success Criteria:** A single-page React component-based form, styled according to the provided screenshots, is implemented for the new deployment wizard. The form will manage its state locally on the client-side. Upon final submission (e.g., "Deploy Now" or "Accept & Continue" on the payment step), the collected form data will be logged to the console, as backend integration will come in a later phase.

1.  **Main Page Structure: (`page.tsx`)** 
    *   Create a top-level component for the "New Deployment" wizard.
    *   Implement client-side state management for current step and form data.
    *   Reusable components for wizard navigation (e.g., Header with back arrow, step indicators if applicable, "Continue" / "Back" / "Deploy Now" buttons).
    *   Apply general styling (dark theme, layout) based on screenshots.
    *   Success Criteria: Basic wizard shell is in place, allowing navigation between conceptual steps (even if steps are empty initially).

2.  **Accordion Scaffolding: (`page.tsx` using Radix UI)**
    *   Implement Radix UI Accordion component.
    *   Create accordion items: Foundation Model, Hardware Configuration, Scaling Configuration, Environment Configuration, Security Settings.

    *   Implement a fixed/sticky footer.
    *   Apply glassmorphism effect (backdrop-blur, opacity).
    *   Display placeholder for 'Estimated Cost' and 'Deploy Now' button.
    *   Basic cost calculation logic (updates based on some initial fields).
    *   Success Criteria: Floating footer is in place, with basic cost calculation.

    *   Implement UI for environment type, region, request priority, env vars, secrets.
    *   Success Criteria: User can configure environment settings.

8.  **Accordion Content - Security Settings:**
    *   Implement UI for access control, private endpoint, request logging, API token - (`SecuritySettingsSelector.tsx` created and integrated, awaiting verification).
    *   Success Criteria: User can configure security settings.

9.  **Implement full dynamic cost calculation based on all form inputs.**
    *   Success Criteria: Estimated cost updates dynamically based on user input.

10. **Terms of Service Step (Modal or separate section).**
    *   Success Criteria: User can view terms of service.

11. **Payment Method Step (Modal or separate section).**
    *   Success Criteria: User can input payment method.

12. **Deployment Progress/Detail Views (post-MVP or separate pages).**
    *   Success Criteria: User can view deployment progress and details.

**Phase 2: Database Schemas (Drizzle)**

13. **Define Model Schema:**
    *   Create `models` table schema in `lib/db/schema.ts`.
    *   Fields: `id` (PK), `name`, `description`, `type` (e.g., 'chat', 'completion'), `size` (e.g., '7B', '70B'), `contextWindow` (e.g., '4K', '32K'), `pricingInput` (per 1M tokens), `pricingOutput` (per 1M tokens), `status` (e.g., 'available', 'preview'), `provider` (e.g., 'Meta', 'DeepSeek'), `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
    *   Seed initial model data (mock).
    *   Success Criteria: Drizzle schema for models is defined, and migrations are generated and applied. Mock data is queryable.

14. **Define FineTuningJob Schema:**
    *   Create `fineTuningJobs` table schema in `lib/db/schema.ts`.
    *   Fields: `id` (PK), `userId` (FK to users), `baseModelId` (FK to models), `suffix` (user-defined), `jobType` (e.g., 'SFT', 'DPO'), `status` (e.g., 'pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled'), `runTime`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `trainingFileId` (reference to uploaded file), `validationFileId` (optional), `errorMessages` (TEXT).
    *   Success Criteria: Drizzle schema for fine-tuning jobs is defined, migrations generated and applied.

15. **Define Deployment Schema (incorporating New Deployment Form fields):**
    *   Create `deployments` table schema in `lib/db/schema.ts`.
    *   Fields: `id` (PK), `userId` (FK to users), `modelId` (FK to models or store model details directly), `endpointName`, `status` (e.g., 'provisioning', 'active', 'inactive', 'failed', 'deleted'), `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `requestsCount` (INT, default 0), `avgLatencyMs` (INT, default 0).
    *   Additional fields from the form: `configurationPreset` (text), `selectedModelSize` (text), `hardwareConfig` (jsonb or text), `scalingConfig` (jsonb or text), `environmentConfig` (jsonb or text), `securitySettings` (jsonb or text), `estimatedHourlyCost` (numeric), `estimatedMonthlyCost` (numeric).
    *   Success Criteria: Drizzle schema for deployments, capable of storing all form data, is defined, migrations generated and applied.

**Phase 3: Mock API Routes (Next.js Route Handlers)**

16. **Models API Routes:**
    *   `GET /api/deploy/models`: List available models (from the `models` table).
    *   Success Criteria: Frontend can fetch a list of available models for the wizard.

17. **Fine-tuning API Routes:**
    *   (As previously planned, if fine-tuning choices impact deployment options, otherwise can be deferred)

18. **Deployments API Routes (New & Existing):
    *   `POST /api/deploy/deployments`: Create a new deployment.
        *   Mock: Accept all data from the New Deployment Form. Create a record in `deployments` table with 'provisioning' status. Simulate provisioning (provisioning -> active/failed).
    *   `GET /api/deploy/deployments`: List user's deployments.
    *   `GET /api/deploy/deployments/{deploymentId}`: Get details.
    *   `DELETE /api/deploy/deployments/{deploymentId}`: Delete.
    *   Success Criteria: The New Deployment Form can submit its data. Other parts of the UI can list and view deployments.

**Phase 4: Backend Integration & Refinement**

19. Connect New Deployment Form UI to the `POST /api/deploy/deployments` API route.
20. Ensure data from the form is correctly saved to the database via the API.
21. Refine UI to fetch data from mock APIs (e.g., available models, existing deployments).
22. Implement actual (simulated) deployment logic triggered by API, updating status in DB.
    *   Success Criteria: The end-to-end flow from form submission to (mock) deployment creation and status update is functional.
